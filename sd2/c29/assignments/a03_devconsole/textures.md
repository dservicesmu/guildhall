- Creating a Texture from an Image
- UV considerations (v is flipped from GL)
  - fix up during construction
    - `vec2 FixUV(vec2 uv)` as part of `RenderCommon.hpp` that can be API specific is a nice approach here.
  - fix in shader
  - flip the texture on load (do not recommend, though Unity goes this route)
- Creating a Sampler
  - What does a sampler do
  - What are the options
  - When will you have to revisit this code?
- Using this in a shader
